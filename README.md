## Hey, I'm **Sam Keller**

I'm a full-stack student dev focused on **Angular**, **ASP.NET Core**, and **MongoDB**.  
I build apps with clean architecture and scalable backend logic.

I'm looking for opportunities where I can:

- Contribute to real full-stack projects
- Work with teams who care about code quality and maintainability
- Keep learning, stay humble, and solve problems

*Available for internships, remote roles, or junior developer positions.*
