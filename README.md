## Hey, I'm Sam Keller

Aspiring Full-Stack Dev | Angular + .NET Core + MongoDB  

I'm a senior IT student focused on full-stack web development. I build scalable, real-world applications using **Angular**, **ASP.NET Core**, and **MongoDB**—with clean architecture and real backend logic, not just templates.

I care about clear code, good UI, and building things that actually work. My background in digital media helps me think like a user, while my backend-first mindset ensures everything scales cleanly.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm looking for opportunities where I can:

- Contribute to **real full-stack projects**
- Work with teams who care about **code quality and maintainability**
- Keep learning, stay humble, and solve problems

I’m available for internships, remote roles, or junior developer positions starting **Spring 2026**. But if you're hiring smart, self-driven talent *now*, I’m already doing the work.
